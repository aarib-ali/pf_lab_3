1. Take input of a number.
2. For each input:
- Check if the number is divisible by 2.
- If it is divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0), then the number is even.
- If it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 1), then the number is odd.
- Print or store the result for each number, indicating whether it is even or odd.
3. Repeat for all inputs
